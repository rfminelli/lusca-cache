/*
 * CPU Profiling implementation.
 * 
 *  This library implements the Probes needed to gather stats.
 *  See src/ProfStats.c which implements historical recording and
 *  presentation in CacheMgr.cgi.
 * 
 *  For timing we prefer on-CPU ops that retrieve cpu ticks counter.
 *  For Intel, this is "rdtsc", which is 64-bit counter that virtually
 *  never wraps. For alpha, this is "rpcc" which is 32-bit counter and
 *  wraps every few seconds. Currently, no handling of wrapping counters
 *  is implemented. Other CPU's are also not covered. Potentially all
 *  modern CPU's has similar counters.
 * 
 * Usage.
 *  Insert macro PROF_state(probename) in strategic places in code.
 *    PROF_start(probename);
 *     ...  section of code measured ...
 *    PROF_stop(probename);
 * 
 *   probename must be added to profiling.h into xprof_type enum list
 *   with prepended "XPROF_" string.
 *
 * Description.
 *  PROF gathers stats per probename into structures. It indexes these
 *  structures by enum type index in an array.
 * 
 *  PROF records best, best, average and worst values for delta time,
 *  also, if UNACCED is defined, it measures "empty" time during which
 *  no probes are in measuring state. This allows to see time "unaccounted"
 *  for. If OVERHEAD is defined, additional calculations are made at every
 *  probe to measure approximate overhead of the probe code itself.
 * 
 *  Probe data is stored in linked-list, so the more probes you define,
 *  the more overhead is added to find the deepest nested probe. To reduce
 *  average overhead, linked list is manipulated each time PR_start is
 *  called, so that probe just started is moved 1 position up in linkedlist.
 *  This way frequently used probes are moved closer to the head of list,
 *  reducing average overhead.
 *  Note that all overhead is on the scale of one hundred of CPU clock
 *  ticks, which on the scale of submicroseconds. Yet, to optimise really
 *  fast and frequent sections of code, we want to reduce this overhead
 *  to absolute minimum possible.
 * 
 *  For actual measurements, probe overhead cancels out mostly. Still,
 *  do not take the measured times as facts, they should be viewed in
 *  relative comparison to overall CPU time and on the same platform.
 * 
 *  Every 1 second, Event within squid is called that parses gathered
 *  statistics of every probe, and accumulates that into historical
 *  structures for last 1,5,30 secs, 1,5,30 mins, and 1,5 and 24 hours.
 *  Each second active probe stats are reset, and only historical data
 *  is presented in cachemgr output.
 * 
 * Reading stats.
 *  "Worst case" may be misleading. Anything can happen at any section
 *  of code that could delay reaching to probe stop. For eg. system may
 *  need to service interrupt routine, task switch could occur, or page
 *  fault needs to be handled. In this sense, this is quite meaningless
 *  metric. "Best case" shows fastest completion of probe section, and
 *  is also somewhat useless, unless you know that amount of work is
 *  constant. Best metric to watch is "average time" and total cumulated
 *  time in given timeframe, which really show percentage of time spent
 *  in given section of code, and its average completion time. This data
 *  could be used to detect bottlenecks withing squid and optimise them.
 * 
 *  TOTALS are quite off reality. Its there just to summarise cumulative
 *  times and percent column. Percent values over 100% shows that there
 *  have been some probes nested into each other.
