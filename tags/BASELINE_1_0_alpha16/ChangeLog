	- use cached_error() instead of CACHED_RETRIEVE_ERROR_MSG
	- fix some fd discprencies in the cachemgr/info page
	- Fixed "defer/spin" problem
	- Changed ftpget to be a server so cached never forks
	- Added blocklist patch
	- Changed #includes and such.
	- the -d (debug) option is now gone.  Use new "debug" in the
	  config file instead.  Debugging is section,level.
	- Added 'pid_filename' to cached.conf
	- Changed default behaviour to unbuffered, use -b to make buffered.
	- fix byte order conversion bug on echo port
	- Removed all code and references to binary port
	- WAIS fully compiled in always.
	- Implemented IMS-GET and change-key-until-headers-read
	- added 'visible_hostname' config option
	- Made check_valid_url() do URL equivalencing
	- Fixed logging:  Now logging to "access.log" occurs when the
	  client data structure gets destroyed. This should mean that
	  every client connection results in a log entry. The
	  ``TCP_DONE'' tag is no longer used. Instead ``TCP_MISS'' is
	  logged with a valid size. ``TCP_MISS_TTL'' has been changed
	  to ``TCP_EXPIRED.'' Because logging occurs when the client
	  connection is closed all connections should have a valid
	  size. Note we're only logging the client side. It might be
	  useful to also log the server side to get really accurate
	  numbers for the traffic comming into and out of the cache.
	- Changed access log format (non-common) to include request
	  method and sub-second timestamps.
	- removed special case for ECONNRESET (and warning message)
	- Significant change to storage manager.  Now only add objects
	  to the hash table if they are public.  This means some 
	  StoreEntry's will be around with null keys.
	- Had to add a flag for using private keys with ICP queries to
	  neighbors.  If any neighbor returns a reqnum field of zero,
	  then disable using private keys.  But still use private
	  keys for things with bypass the ICP query step (such as
	  POST and IMS-GET).
	- eliminated dual logging to stderr/debug_log
	- added 'ftp_user' to config
	- added improved IP ACL routines; now handles netmasks.
	- Added storeEntryValidLength().  Objects with invalid 
	  content lengths will be ejected.
	- Added clean shutdown mode.  On SIGTERM, close incoming and 
	  dnsserver sockets.  When no sockets left in select loop
	  return and exit.
	- Added support for shttp and CONNECT urls.
	- Added support for large POST objects.
	- Started arranging for HUP to re-read config file.
	- Created struct _http_reply to hold reply fields.
	  Elmininates need for storeMatchMime() in ttl.c.
	- fixed use of storeSetPublicKey() in ftp/gopher/wais.  Now
	  call at end of *SendRequest().
	- Fixed converting gopher to HTML bug, removed html_request
	  field of gopherData;
	- Open server sockets _after_ storeRebuild() so many incoming
	  connections don't stack up on the listen queue.
	- Created "store.log" which logs RELEASE/SWAPIN/SWAPOUT events.
	- Added announce to cached; no longer external program.
	- Added ftpProcessReplyHeader() (a twin of the one in http.c).
	- Fixed bad free() in ipcacheShtudownServers()
	- Cleaned up FTP url parsing; support port.
	- SIGHUP reconfigures the cache
	- SIGUSR1 rotates logfiles.
	- New ACLs
	- added dns_positive_ttl
	- Added Forwarded: header to proxy HTTP requests
	- Fixed reqnum bug (was using ntohs instead of ntohl).
	- Fixed double free() bug caused by setting flag=0 in
	  storeAddFromDisk().
	- Fixed memory leaks.
	- Check specifically for tm_gmtoff and set HAVE_TM_GMTOFF
	- Fixed memory problem for colon but no port ("http://foo.com:/")
