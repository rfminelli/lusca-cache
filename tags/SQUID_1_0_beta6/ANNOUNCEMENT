A new, free WWW cache server is now available for beta testing.  This
is derivative of the Harvest object cache (``Cached'') and is named
``Squid.'' It picks up where cached-1.4.pl3 left off.  A number of new
features have been added, including:

	- Improved parsing of HTTP requests and replies.
	- Handling of If-Modified-Since GET requests.
	- Background reloading of cache metadata on restart.
	- Extensive access control mechanisms.
	- Improved and more accurate access logging.
	- HUP signal causes the configuration file to be re-read.
	- Support for SSL.
