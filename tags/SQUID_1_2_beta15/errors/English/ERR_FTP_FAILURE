<H2>The requested URL could not be retrieved</H2>
<HR>
<P>
An FTP protocol error occurred
while trying to retrieve the URL:
<A HREF="%U">%U</A>
<P>
Squid sent the following FTP command:
<PRE><STRONG>
	%f
</STRONG></PRE>
and then received this reply
<PRE><STRONG>
	%F
</STRONG></PRE>
<P>
This might be caused by an FTP URL with an absolute path (which does
not comply with RFC 1738).  If this is the cause, then the file
can be found at <A HREF="%B">%B</A>.
