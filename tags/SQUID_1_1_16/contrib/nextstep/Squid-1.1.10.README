This is the README file for Squid-1.1.10.pkg

This package has not been checked under NEXTSTEP 4.x. Please tell me if it
works. The software has not been checked on sparc and hppa architectures.
Again, please tell me if it works.

Note: I don't have the time to tell you how Squid works. Go to http://squid.nlanr.net for details.

Yours,
