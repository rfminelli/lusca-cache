9 December 1998, version 0.02

- smb_auth now uses Samba instead of pam_smb. This simplifies the
  installation of smb_auth and increases platform support.

- Access control by user and group: smb_auth now tries to read
  the file \netlogon\proxyauth. By restricting read access on
  this file access to the proxy can be controlled.

- Easier configuration:

  - smb_auth is now fully configurable with command-line options
    (i.e. in squid.conf). No more hacking in the source code.

  - In most cases it is sufficient to specify just the domain name.
    smb_auth searches for a working domain controller on each
    authentication request (note that Squid caches valid requests).

- Easier installation: Makefile added. Simply typing "make install"
  will work for most people.

- In a multi-domain situation, users must now enter domain\user
  instead of user\domain. This conforms to NT notation. Thanks to
  Jason Haar <Jason.Haar@trimble.co.NZ> for pointing this out.
