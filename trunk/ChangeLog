	- Fixed UDP_HIT_OBJ objects ignoring 'proxy-only' setting.
	- Added setting cachemgr.cgi fields from query string
	  (Neil Murray).
	- Split log type TCP_IFMODSINCE into TCP_IMS_HIT and
	  TCP_IMS_MISS
	- Replaced proto_hit() and proto_miss() with proto_count()
	  which looks at log_type argument to calcultate hits
	  and misses.
	- Split CacheInfo into HTTPCacheInfo and ICPCacheInfo.
	- Placed call to proto_count() just after log_append()
	  so we only need it in one place.

	  before IMS.
	- Fixed aclDestroyDenyInfoList() to NULL free'd lists.

	- Added -k signal option to signal a running Squid (Markus Gyger).
	- Removed dynamic_array code.

Changes to squid-1.1.alpha17:

	- Added more IMS support.  Now Squid issues IMS requests for
	  expired objects in the cache.  Log type will be either
	  TCP_EXPIRED_HIT if the server sends "304 Not Modified" or
	  TCP_EXPIRED_MISS if the server send a new object.
	- Added Config.expireAge and 'expire_age' to config.

	- Removed some 'Reset header fields for reply' crap.
	- added old_entry member to icpStateData for handling IMS
	  requests.
	- Added 'locks' member to ipcache_entry; need to lock an
	  ipcache entry during ipcache_call_pending().
	- Removed ipcache_call_pending_badname().
	- Cleaned up setting/clearing IP_LOOKUP_PENDING bit.
	- Removed storeEntryLocked() trap in storePurgeMem().
	- Added storeCheckExpired().
	- Removed storeWalkThrough() and removeOldEntry(), changed
	  storePurgeOld() to do the walking through instead.

	- Fixed numerous compiler problems.

Changes to squid-1.1.alpha14:

	- Fixed ENTRY_DISPATCHED bug.  ENTRY_DISPATCHED was not always
	  getting set (e.g. for requests matching hierarchy_stoplist).
	  This could cause multiple calls to storeAbort() for the same
	  entry.
	- With ENTRY_DISPATCHED now fixed, call squid_error_entry()
	  from protoUnregister() for StoreEntries which have not
	  been dispatched.
	- Fixed 'quick_abort' parsing bug.
	- NULL terminate too-long URL strings in urlParse().  Still
	  need fix to somehow handle these.

	  has to be running, but the disk(s) have not been fsck'd yet.
	- quick_abort actually works now
	- quick_abort functionality made conditional
	- ttl_pattern storage wasn't being cleaned upon a reread of
	  the config file (the patterns were added only, got duplicates)
	- ttl_force_pattern a new config option to override the settings
	  of certain pages despite (or because) of enforced low expiry times
	- Reduced the struct sentry size.  Moved some attributes to mem_obj,
	  eliminated some.  On typical 32-bit machines the size was 52 bytes,
	  now it's 32.

	  sure the entire request is read.

Changes to squid-1.0.beta1 (Apr 19, 1996) from Harvest cached-1.4.pl3:

	- Added a "server mode" to ftpget.  Now the (much smaller)
	  ftpget process forks for each FTP request.
	- Added support for If-Modified-Since GET requests.
	- Added support for SSL and https objects.
	- Added background processing for rebuilding the disk store
	  while serving requests.  Cache can now serve requests immediately.
	- Added a 'reconfigure' feature activated by SIGHUP.  The config
	  file is re-read and most changes will take effect.
	- Added an internal flag for using private keys with ICP queries
	  to neighbors.  If any neighbor returns a reqnum field of zero,
	  then disable using private keys.  But still use private
	  keys for things with bypass the ICP query step (such as POST
	  and IMS-GET).
	- Added a function to verify content-lengths.  Objects with
	  mismatched (but non-zero) content lenghts will be ejected.
	- Added clean shutdown mode.  On SIGTERM the incoming HTTP socket
	  is closed.  Active clients are given a lifetime of 30 seconds
	  (configurable).  Process exits when all sockets are closed.
	- Added support for large POST objects.
	- Added "store.log" which logs RELEASE/SWAPIN/SWAPOUT events.
	- Added announce feature to squid; no longer external program.
	  If enabled, a running cache will announce itself every 24 hrs.
	- Added support for FTP URLs with non-default ports.
	- Added new Access Control List scheme.
	- Added Forwarded: header to proxy HTTP requests (HTTP/1.1 feature).
	- Added weights neighbors.
	- Added urlParse() which strips off default ports and 
	  makes hostnames all lowercase.
	- Added (section,level) debugging and 'debug_options' config line.
	- Added 'pid_filename' to configuration file.
	- Added 'visible_hostname' to configuration file.
	- added 'ftp_user' to configuration file.
	- added 'dns_positive_ttl' to configuration file.
	- added 'dns_negative_ttl' to configuration file.
	- Added 'shutdown_lifetime' to configuration file.
	- Fixed bug where cache process would "spin" on large objects
	  being deferred.
	- Fixed byte order conversion bug on setting echo port.
	- Changed meaning of command line -b (buffered logs) option.
	  Now the default behaviour is unbuffered logs, use -b to make
	  them buffered.
	- Changed WAIS code to always be fully compiled in.
	- Changed the storage manager to use the notion of private and
	  public keys.  Requests are now private until the reply headers
	  have been read.
	- Changed access logging significantly.  Entries to "access.log"
	  are written when the client connection closes.  Every connection
	  is logged exactly once, always with a valid size.
	- Changed access log format (non-common) to include request
	  method and sub-second timestamps.
	- Changed handing of ECONNRESET (connection reset) errors.
	  Now treated like any other read error.
	- Changed 'rotate logs' to be activated by SIGUSR1.
	- Changed configure script to look specifically for tm_gmtoff
	  and set HAVE_TM_GMTOFF.
	- Changed configure script to look specifically extended mallinfo
	  structure and set HAVE_EXT_MALLINFO
	- Changed ICP reply code to use negative TTL value as UDP_HIT
	  threshold so we never return a HIT on neg-cached objects.
	- Changed ftpget to use select(2) on I/O for timeouts.  ftpget
	  now exits immediately if stdin goes away.
	- Changed handling of '-z' option.  Now only execute 'rm -rf ...' if
	  -U option also given.
	- Removed the command line -d (debug) option.  Use 'debug_options'
	  in config file.
	- Removed all code and references to binary port.
	- Removed dual logging to stderr/cache.log.
	- Removed old IP access controls ('proxy_allow', etc.)
