This LDAP Authentication code is maintained by Henrik Nordstrom
<hno@squid-cache.org> who added command line options, and
the ability to search for the user DN to log in as.

The original LDAP Authentication code is written by Glen Newton
<gnewton@wapiti.cisti.nrc.ca>.

Please also see his Web page at:

In order to use squid_ldap_auth, you will also need to install
the OpenLDAP libraries (ldap lber) from http://www.openldap.org.
