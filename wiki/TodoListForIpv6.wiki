#summary What stuff needs to happen for IPv6 support
#labels Project

This isn't an exhaustive list!

  * Grab the SNMP changes in Squid-3 which support IPv6 related lookup keys, throw it in
  * Convert the client db code over to support IPv4/IPv6 addresses
   * .. which requires porting the SNMP client db code too
  * The persistent connection code will need changing - can just fudge the hash code to use a longer string for the key for now; perhaps migrate to a proper tree structure later?
  * ACL support for IPv6 - already mostly done in branches; it just needs to be committed
