#summary An overview of the Lusca Web Proxy/Cache Architecture

= Introduction =

Lusca is a single process application which processes network traffic in a (now) traditional callback-based event notification style framework.

It uses POSIX threads for disk IO and external processes for a variety of tasks (logfile writing, ACL helpers, authentication helpers, URL rewriting, etc.)

This architecture overview t is not designed to be completely thorough; it is meant to introduce the general structure and data flow of Lusca.

= Sections =

== Core framework ==

  * [LuscaArchitectureEventOverview] - the event-driven callback framework overview
  * [LuscaArchitectureNetwork] - the network framework
  * [LuscaArchitectureCallbackData] - the callback data registry and reference counting
  * [LuscaArchitectureMemoryManagement] - basic memory management
  * [LuscaArchitectureDiskIO] - the legacy disk IO mechanism
  * [LuscaArchitectureAsyncDiskIO] - the thread-based async disk IO mechanism
  * [LuscaArchitectureHelpers] - using external helper processes
  * [LuscaArchitectureDebugging] - the debugging framework

== Storage framework ==

  * [LuscaArchitectureStorageLayer] - the store layer
  * [LuscaArchitectureStoreVary] - supporting Vary objects
  * [LuscaArchitectureStoreIndex] - maintaining the store index
  * [LuscaArchitectureStoreClientLayer] - client-side storage interface
  * [LuscaArchitectureStoreServerLayer] - the server-side storage interface
  * [LuscaArchitectureStoreMemory] - the store memory layer, and how it is used as a "hot object cache"
  * [LuscaArchitectureStoreDisk] - the store disk layer

  * [LuscaArchitectureStoreShortcomings] - shortcomings in the current storage layer


== HTTP processing framework ==

  * [LuscaArchitectureClientSide] - the client-side path, handling client requests
  * [LuscaArchitectureForwarding] - request forwarding
  * [LuscaArchitecturePeerSelection] - various peer selection methods
  * [LuscaArchitectureHttpServerSide] - the HTTP server-side path, communicating to peers and servers
  * [LuscaArchitectureFtpServerSide] - the FTP server-side path, communicating to FTP servers
