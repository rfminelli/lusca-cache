#summary Mailing lists.

= Introduction =

There's a few mailing lists:

  * cacheboy-dev@googlegroups.com - [http://groups.google.com/group/cacheboy-dev] - development discussion
  * cacheboy-users@googlegroups.com - [http://groups.google.com/group/cacheboy-users] - user discussion
  * cacheboy-commit@googlegroups.com - [http://groups.google.com/group/cacheboy-commit] - commit messages

The automated commit messages don't seem to be appearing yet - I'll see if I can figure that one out.
