#summary How the source is laid out!

= Introduction =

The one thing to remember is that development doesn't happen off trunk.

= Layout =

  * Squid-2.HEAD is tracked in /svn/trunk
  * Cacheboy development is in /svn/branches/CACHEBOY_PRE
  * Project playpens are in /svn/playpen/ ; generally branched off CACHEBOY_PRE

= Merging =

  * Squid-2.HEAD changes are imported, changeset at a time, into /svn/trunk (so it should mostly resemble the CVS repository)
  * Changes are then merged into /svn/branches/CACHEBOY_PRE, so it constantly tracks Squid-2.HEAD (this may change if Squid-2.HEAD becomes unnecessarily unstable for some reason..)
  * Playpen work/changes are folded into /svn/branches/CACHEBOY_PRE when ready

= Releases =

  * Releases are made off /svn/branches/CACHEBOY_PRE by laying down tags in /svn/tags
  * Major releases don't cause a branch yet - the codebase is still undergoing widescale changes and trying to deal with multiple concurrent branches would be a nightmare. This will change when the codebase settles down.
