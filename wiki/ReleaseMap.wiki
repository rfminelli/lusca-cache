#summary What is actually going on in the releases?

The RoadMap page may be .. cluttered and disorganised. Its primarily designed so Adrian can document and keep track of what is going on.

This is a higher-level summary.

Cacheboy-1.X is mostly focused on breaking apart the Squid codebase into higher level modules. These modules can then be tested and re-used independently of the Squid application.
