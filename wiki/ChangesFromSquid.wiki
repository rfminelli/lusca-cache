#summary What exactly has changed between Squid-2.HEAD and Cacheboy?

= Features =

  * Internal DNS code supports IPv6 and IPv4 DNS hosts (but still currently only implements an IPv4 aware API even if most of the internal code implements IPv4/IPv6 lookups.)
  * AUFS defaults to all operations being async, versus Squid's default of only open(), read() and unlink() - improving Solaris and FreeBSD performance.

= Structural Changes =

A large amount of code has been moved out of src/ and into individual top-level libraries:

  * Shared core routines are in libcore/
  * Debugging (file, stderr, syslog) is in libsqdebug/
  * Memory and String handling in libmem/
  * IPC and helper handling in libhelper/
  * basic network socket, disk, pipe, fifo FD handling, event loop and signal handling in libiapp/
  * callback data handling in libcb/
  * a couple of MIME related routines (specifically headersEnd()) in libmime/
  * Various HTTP header, header entry and parser routines in libhttp/
  * Ident support in libsqident/
  * Statistical manipulation routines (for histograms, etc) in libstat/
  * storage memory pipeline in libstmem/
  * Internal and external DNS code in libsqdns/
  * name-resolution related functions (fqdncache and ipcache) in libsqname/

= Bug Fixes =

  * Some fixes to the namedb and cache digests code relating to the storeClientRef() changes, which eventually need to be brought back into Squid-2.HEAD.
