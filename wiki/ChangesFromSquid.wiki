#summary What exactly has changed between Squid-2.HEAD and Cacheboy?

= Features =

* Internal DNS code supports IPv6 and IPv4 DNS hosts (but still currently only implements an IPv4 aware API even if most of the internal code implements IPv4/IPv6 lookups.)
* AUFS defaults to all operations being async, versus Squid's default of only open(), read() and unlink() - improving Solaris and FreeBSD performance.
