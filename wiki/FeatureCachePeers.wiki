#summary How Squid/Lusca can be forced to use specific upstreams to relay requests
#labels Feature

= Introduction =

Lusca has a very powerful and flexible method for building complex networks of HTTP proxies and upstream servers. These can be used to build both forward proxy networks and reverse proxy / content delivery networks.

= Overview =

[TODO]

= Options =

The general options are documented in squid.conf.default.

= Differences to Squid =

  * In the case of a fully transparent interception proxy (eg tproxy), upstream peers may or may not need to have the client IP address spoofed. In this case, the option "no-tproxy" forces connections to the cache peer to use the traditional outbound IP address selection versus the client spoofed address.
