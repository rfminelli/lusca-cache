#summary Current IPv6 support in Cacheboy

= Overview =

The IPv6 support in Cacheboy is not as fully-featured as Squid-3.HEAD / Squid-3.1; it is still in development.

The current aim is to thoroughly test and deploy client-side IPv6 before moving onto a complete IPv6 implementation.

== Protocols ==

  * Client-side handling: done
  * Server-side handling: not done
  * HTCP: not done
  * ICPv2: not done
  * ICPv3: not done
  * SNMP: not done
  * FTP: not done
  * Gopher: not done

== Modules ==

  * External DNS: not done
  * Internal DNS: done
  * FQDNCache: not done
  * IPCache: not done
  * Incoming network connections: done
  * Outgoing network connections: done
  * Logging: done; address not yet wrapped in []'s
  * Redirectors: done; address not wrapped in []'s
  * Client database: done
  * Persistent connection logic: done

== ACLs ==

  * Support for src6 and myip6
  * No support for dst6 - requires FQDNCache to function
  * No support for srcdomain / srcregex - requires IPCache to function

== Headers ==

 * X-Forwarded-For: supported; but doesn't yet wrap the IPv6 address in []'s

== SNMP ==

 * Client database: not done
 * Peer database: not done

== Other ==

  * FQDN entry logging: not done; requires FQDNCache to function
  * Hostname from http_port configuration: not done; requires DNS to function
  * Various debugging: logging the _IP_ address requires a conditional call to sqinet_ntoa() (ie, only if the debugging call will output something); the debugging code thus needs to be extended first!
