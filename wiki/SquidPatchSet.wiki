#summary Which Patches to integrate

= Introduction =

There's no nice, simple script that I can find to apply CVS patchsets (from cvsps) to Subversion repos previously setup with cvs2svn.

This page is just a placeholder to manually track patchsets that need merging into the Squid 'trunks'.

At some point a tool should be written to do this!

= Patchsets =

The initial import included all patchsets up to 12036.

  * 12037 - *committed*
  * 12038 - *committed*
  * 12039 - *committed*
  * 12040 - *committed*
  * 12041 - *committed*
  * 12042 - *committed*
