#summary How to build from the source code

= Basics =

  # Setup compilers and AutoTools
    * gcc 3.x and 4.x are ok.
    * If your system lacks uudecode, install sharutils.
  # DownloadSource
  # ./bootstrap.sh
  # ./configure
  # make install

== Configure options ==

TODO: Some docs better than --help are preferable.

== Prepare source tree =

Most of the source codes in svn are set "svn:eol-tyle=native" property. On the other hand, bash (/bin/sh) requires [http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-announce/2007-01/msg00015.html LF-ended lines by default]. So you need to:
  * Checkout with Cygwin's svn command.
  * Mount your working directory with the [http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using.html#mount-table text option] if you stick with Windows-based svn clients (e.g. TortoiseSVN)
  * Use bash with igncr option (not tested)

Note that the text option is not perfect. {{{echo 1 >n.txt; echo 2 >>n.txt; echo `cat n.txt`}}} and see the result.

cf. http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-textbinary.html

== Required packages ==

  * automake
  * gcc4
  * make
  * sharutils

== Build ==

Nothing special. Just note that your filesystem is c:\cygwin rooted.

= MinGW =

We assume cross-compiling on Cygwin.

== Required packages ==

Cygwin's requirements plus:

  * gcc-mingw
  
== Build ==

  # ./bootstrap.sh
  # CC="gcc-3 -mno-cygwin" ./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32 --enable-win32-service
  # make install
