#summary Little projects which shouldn't be difficult for an interested person to complete!

= Mini Projects =

These are little projects which need doing that should be doable for a newcomer to the project.

== Error Pages ==

Better error pages are needed.

My current playpen: [http://code.google.com/p/cacheboy/source/browse/playpen/errors/]

The basic outline:

  * Figure out a "good" CSS layout for the error documents
  * Build one or two example CSS files to demonstrate the flexibility of the error page layout
  * Begin converting the error pages into the "new world order"

Notes!

  * Squid/Cacheboy -can- serve static content (as icons!) so the initial error pages will need the CSS included in-line rather than referencing an external CSS document. This should be done anyway as serving error pages can happen during "errors" and it'd be unfortunate if something required on a error page generated an error..
