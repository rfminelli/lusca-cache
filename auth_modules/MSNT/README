_____________________________________


This is a simple authentication module for the Squid proxy server
to authenticate users on an NT domain.

It originates from the Samba and SMB packages by Andrew Tridgell
and Richard Sharpe. This version is sourced from the Pike
authentication module by William Welliver (hwellive@intersil.com).

Its use is simple. It accepts a username and password on standard input
and will return OK if the username/password is valid for the domain,
or ERR if there was some problem.

You will need to modify the NT server definitions for your site;
this is the NT PDC server and domain to authenticate to.
This is done in smbauth.c.

Msntauth is released under the GNU General Public License and
is available from http://members.tripod.com/~antonino.

Installation -

Modify smbauth.c as needed.
type 'make', then 'make install', then 'make clean'.
The default is to install 'msntauth' into /usr/local/squid/bin.

Compilation issues -

The Makefile assumes that GCC is in the current PATH.
Msntauth is known to compile properly on Redhat Linux 6, FreeBSD 3.1
without problems. Other operating systems are untested,
but use a recent copy of the GNU C compiler.
Smbencrypt.c has the '#include <sys/vfs.h>' line commented out.
Remove the comments for S5R4 systems, like Solaris.
