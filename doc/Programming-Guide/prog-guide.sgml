<abstract>
Squid is a WWW Cache application developed by the National Laboratory
for Applied Network Research and members of the Web Caching community.
Squid is implemented as a single, non-blocking process based around
a BSD select() loop.  This document describes the operation of the Squid
source code and is intended to be used by others who wish to customize
or improve it.

<!-- %%%% Chapter : INTRODUCTION %%%% -->
<sect>Introduction

<P>
The Squid source code has evolved more from empirical observation and
tinkering, rather than a solid design process.  It carries a legacy of
being ``touched'' by numerous individuals, each with somewhat different
techniques and terminology.  

<P>
Squid is a single-process proxy server.  Every request is handled by
the main process, with the exception of FTP.  However, Squid does not
use a ``threads package'' such has Pthreads.  While this might be 
easier to code, it suffers from portability and performance problems.
Instead Squid maintains data structures and state information for
each active request.

<P>
The code is often difficult to follow because there are no explicit
state variables for the active requests.  Instead, thread execution
progresses as a sequence of ``handler functions'' which get called
when I/O is ready to occur.  As a handler completes, it will register
another handler for the next time I/O occurs.

<P>
Note there is only a pseudo-consistent naming scheme.  In most 
cases functions are named like <tt/moduleFooBar()/.  However, there
are also some functions named like <tt/module_foo_bar()/.

<P>
Note that the Squid source changes rapidly, and some parts of this
document may become out-of-date.  If you find any inconsistencies, please
feel free to notify

<sect1>Conventions

<P>
Function names and file names will be written in a courier font, such
as <em/store.c/ and <tt/storeRegister()/.  Data structures and their
members will be written in an italicised font, such as <em/StoreEntry/.

<sect>The Big Picture

<P>
Squid consists of the following major components

<sect1>Client Side

<P>
    These routines exist primarily in two source files: <em/cp.c/, and
    <em/client_side.c/.  The name <em/icp.c/ is misleading, as it
    has more to do with accepting HTTP requests than the ICP protocol.

<P>
    This is where new client connections are accepted and processed.
    This is where we determine if the request is a HIT, REFRESH, MISS, etc.
    The client-side state for each request is held in an <tt/icpStateData/
    structure.
    
<sect1>Server Side

<P>
    These routines exist in various source files.  <em/proto.c/
    contains generic server-side functions, notably the neighbor
    selection algorithms.  Protocol-specific functions are in
    <em/http.c/,
    <em/ftp.c/,
    <em/gopher.c/,
    <em/wais.c/,
    <em/ssl.c/,
    and <em/pass.c/.

<P>
    This is where server connections are made, and replies are read.
    Apart from processing headers, HTTP is relatively simple--just
    copying bytes.  Note that all requests (FTP, Gopher) to other
    proxies are sent as HTTP requests.  Requests to FTP servers are
    handled in the external <tt/ftpget/ process, so the <em/ftp.c/
    functions are simply to communicate with <tt/ftpget/.
    <em/gopher.c/ is somewhat complex and gross because it must
    convert from the Gopher protocol to HTTP.  Wais and Gopher don't
    receive much attention because they are relatively insignificant
    compared to HTTP.

<P>
    <em/ssl.c/ handles SSL requests (the CONNECT method) and
    <em/pass.c/ (``passthrough'') handles uncachable requests which
    the cache doesn't really care about.   These two modules basically
    pass bits back and forth between client and server.  Note they do
    not use a <em/StoreEntry/ to do so.  About the only difference
    between the two is that the SSL module sends a special ``connection
    established'' message.

<sect1>Storage Manager

<P>
    The Storage Manager is the glue between client and server sides.
    Every object saved in the cache is allocated a <em/StoreEntry/
    structure.  While the object is being fetched, it also has a 
    <em/MemObject/ structure.

<P>
    The <em/store.c/ file is quite large.  It includes functions to 
    allocate and deallocate data structures, accept incoming data from
    the server side, and maintain the objects in memory and on disk.

<P>
    Squid can quickly located cached objects because it keeps a hash
    table of all <em/StoreEntry/'s.  
    Current versions of Squid hold in-transit objects fully in memory
    before saving them to disk.  This approach has both advantages
    and disadvantages.  These ``in-memory'' objects are also indexed
    by a separate ``in-memory'' hash table.

<P>
    Objects are saved to disk in a two-level directory structure.  For
    each object the <em/StoreEntry/ includes a 4-byte <em/fileno/
    field.  This file number is converted to a disk pathname by a
    simple algorithm which evenly distributes the files across all 
    cache directories.

<P>
    When new object data arrives on the server side, it is added to the
    <em/StoreEntry/ with the <tt/storeAppend()/ function.  The client
    side registers interest in an object with the <tt/storeRegister()/
    function.  When more data arrives, the client side is notified via
    the callback it has registered.  The client functions then copy 
    the new data from the <em/StoreEntry/ and write it to the 
    client socket.   This approach easily allows multiple clients to
    read from a single <em/StoreEntry/ as it is being fetched.

<sect1>Other Components

<P>
<descrip>
<tag/Neighbors/

    Maintains the list of neighbor caches.  Sends and receives 
    ICP messages to neighbors.  File: <em/neighbors.c/.

<tag>IP/FQDN Cache</tag>

    A cache of name-to-address and address-to-name lookups.  These are
    hash tables keyed on the names and addresses.
    <tt/ipcache_nbgethostbyname()/ and <tt/fqdncache_nbgethostbyaddr()/
    implement the non-blocking lookups.  Files: <em/ipcache.c/,
    <em/fqdncache.c/.

<tag/DNS Servers/

    Because the standard <tt/gethostbyname(3)/ library call blocks,
    Squid must use external processes to actually make these calls.
    Typically there will be ten <tt/dnsserver/ processes spawned from
    Squid.  Communication occurs via TCP sockets bound to the loopback
    interface.  The functions in <em/dns.c/ are primarily concerned
    with starting and stopping the dnsservers.  Reading and writing to
    and from the dnsservers occurs in the IP and FQDN cache modules.

<!-- %%%% Chapter : MAIN LOOP %%%% -->
<sect>The Main Loop: <tt/comm_select()/

<P>
At the core of Squid is the <tt/select(2)/ system call.  Squid uses
<tt/select()/ (or alternatively <tt/poll(2)/ in recent versions) to 
process I/O on all open file descriptors.

<sect1>Comm Handlers

<P>
For every open file descriptor, there are N types of handler functions.
<itemize>
<item>Read
<item>Write
<item>Timeout
<item>Lifetime
<item>Close
</itemize>

<P>
These handlers are stored in the <em/FD_ENTRY/ structure as defined in
<em/comm.h/.  <tt/fd_table[]/ is the global array of <em/FD_ENTRY/
structures.  The handler functions are of type <em/PF/, which is a
typedef:
<verb>
    typedef void (*PF) (int, void *);
</verb>
The close handler is really a linked list of handler functions.
Each handler also has an associated pointer <tt/(void *data)/ to
some kind of data structure.

<P>
<tt/comm_select()/ is the function which issues the select() system
call.  It scans the entire <tt/fd_table[]/ array looking for handler
functions.  Each file descriptor with a read handler will be set in
the <tt/fd_set/ read bitmask.  Similarly, write handlers are scanned and
bits set for the write bitmask.  <tt/select()/ is then called, and the
return read and write bitmasks are scanned for descriptors with pending
I/O.  For each ready descriptor, the handler is called.  Note that
the handler is cleared from the <em/FD_ENTRY/ before it is called.

<P>
After each handler is called, <tt/comm_select_incoming()/ is
called to process new HTTP and ICP requests.

<P>
Typical read handlers are
<tt/httpReadReply()/,
<tt/diskHandleRead()/,
<tt/icpHandleUdp()/,
and <tt/ipcache_dnsHandleRead()/.
Typical write handlers are
<tt/commHandleWrite()/,
<tt/diskHandleWrite()/,
and <tt/icpUdpReply()/.
The handler function is set with <tt/commSetSelect()/, with the
exception of the close handlers, which are set with
<tt/comm_add_close_handler()/.

<P>
The close handlers are normally called from <tt/comm_close()/.  
The job of the close handlers is to deallocate data structures 
associated with the file descriptor.  For this reason <tt/comm_close()/
must normally be the last function in a sequence to prevent accessing
just-freed memory.

<P>
The timeout and lifetime handlers are called for file descriptors which
have been idle for too long.  They are futher discussed in a following 
chapter.
