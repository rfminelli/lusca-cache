 *  
 * TERMS OF USE
 *   
 *   The Harvest software may be used and re-distributed without
 *   charge, provided that the software origin and research team are

 *   accomplished by including a link to the Harvest Home Page

 * DERIVATIVE WORKS
 *  
 *   Users may make derivative works from the Harvest software, subject

 *  
 *     - You must notify IRTF-RD regarding your distribution of 
 *       the derivative work.
 *  
 *     - You must clearly notify users that your are distributing 
 *       a modified version and not the original Harvest software.
 *  
 *     - Any derivative product is also subject to these copyright

 *  
 *   Note that the Harvest software is NOT in the public domain.  We

 *  
 * HISTORY OF FREE SOFTWARE STATUS
 *  
 *   Originally we required sites to license the software in cases
 *   where they were going to build commercial products/services
 *   around Harvest.  In June 1995 we changed this policy.  We now
 *   allow people to use the core Harvest software (the code found in
 *   the Harvest ``src/'' directory) for free.  We made this change
 *   in the interest of encouraging the widest possible deployment of
 *   the technology.  The Harvest software is really a reference
 *   implementation of a set of protocols and formats, some of which
 *   we intend to standardize.  We encourage commercial
 *   re-implementations of code complying to this set of standards.
