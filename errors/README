Error Page generation notes

Some (well, "English" at the time of commit) of the error pages are now
beginning to be template generated.

For example, English/ is now empty. Its populated by having the source directory
(src/English/) passed through "build.pl" and written into "English". "make install"
then works normally.

The only template entry at the moment is @STYLE@. This expands to the in-line
style CSS file (defaulting to "error.css".) The resultant combination is written
out into the error directory during "make install".

TODO: at least document what the stylesheet entries are so others have
a chance of writing customised error page layouts.
