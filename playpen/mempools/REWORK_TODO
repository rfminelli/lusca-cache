* src/main.c has some assignments to iapp_ variables for copying bits of the
  config from Config. out to libiapp; these need to go away before the code
  is merged in.

* start resolving naming space conflicts!

* the debug_log stream is still defined in src/ when it should really be defined
  as part of an external debug logfile library. A lot of "stuff" happens to use
  this that has been shifted out into external libraries.

  So, create a debuglog library, migrate all the code out into -it-, then
  grep through the lib*/ code and find the places where debug_log related code
  has been commented out. Then make it work. :)

* libhelper/helper.c doesn't currently have the Config.sleep_after_fork config
  option accessible and thus it doesn't sleep at all before fork. Figure out a
  clean way to get that value, possibly passed into the helper create functions.
