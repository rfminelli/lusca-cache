* src/main.c has some assignments to iapp_ variables for copying bits of the
  config from Config. out to libiapp; these need to go away before the code
  is merged in.

* start resolving naming space conflicts!

* the debug_log stream is still defined in src/ when it should really be defined
  as part of an external debug logfile library. A lot of "stuff" happens to use
  this that has been shifted out into external libraries.

  So, create a debuglog library, migrate all the code out into -it-, then
  grep through the lib*/ code and find the places where debug_log related code
  has been commented out. Then make it work. :)

* libhelper/helper.c doesn't currently have the Config.sleep_after_fork config
  option accessible and thus it doesn't sleep at all before fork. Figure out a
  clean way to get that value, possibly passed into the helper create functions.

* The internal DNS code is beginning to grow IPv6 awareness; the external DNS code
  however doesn't know the first thing about it. This should be rectified!

* Write tests for:
  * libsqinet/ - all ot it; esp. the splay stuff!
  * lib/ - memrcmp()
* Write tests for:
  * libsqinet/ - all ot it; esp. the splay stuff!
  * lib/ - memrcmp()

* Migrate the damned client_db over to use a splay tree or something; using
  a hash table of textual IP addresses is just plain stupid.

* The disk related code (libiapp/disk.c and libasyncio) API should be unified
  somewhat but doing this -properly- will need some sanity brought to the
  read and write API. Ie, somehow we need to enforce that the supplied buffer
  is still valid upon the execution of the underlying IO. Hm.
