* the code is a bit tangly. Specifically, I'm updating the bgp FSM
  in various places where it should just be driven in bgp_core.c !
  Untangle this mess.

* break out the bgp_read() code and the message dispatch stuff.
  The caller (bgpconn) should be able to just do bgp_read() to put some
  data in the buffer, then bgp_get_message() over and over again.
  It can then drive the FSM how it wants; the RIB addition/deletion
  can happen in the bgpconn code, leaving bgp_core for FSM, and bgp_packet
  for building/parsing BGP stuff.
