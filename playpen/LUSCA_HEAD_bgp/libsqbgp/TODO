* the code is a bit tangly. Specifically, I'm updating the bgp FSM
  in various places where it should just be driven in bgp_core.c !
  Untangle this mess.

* Actually implement a BGP FSM now!

* This implementation stores only the last ASN for now, rather than the whole
  path. Yes, the whole path would be much nicer, esp. to be able to build
  rules which say "if X is from a source which transits AS y", but its not
  needed for now. One would also have to implement AS path hashing/referencing
  to keep that somewhat efficient.

* Add a config flag which overrides the del bit - for RIB calc, immediate del is
  fine. For logging, ACLs, etc, immediate del may not be. Instead, tag the prefix
  as "deleted" so subsequent lookups can determine whether to use the stale
  result or not.

* 0/0 acceptance should be configurable. It may not be desired here as the "default"
  AS would end up catching all traffic, whether it was destined there or not.
