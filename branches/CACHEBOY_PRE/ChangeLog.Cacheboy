* Add in a O(1) FIFO type (allocator overhead notwithstanding) - use it for
  the heap allocation code.

* The helper code now doesn't use a temporary list structure to store
  queued requests (tested)
* The aufs storage code now doesn't use a temporary list structure to store
  temporary lists of pending reads and writes (tested)
* Continued to shuffle around code into seperate libraries
* Changed the way legacy memory pools are initialised - the same MemPools
  code is used but they're setup slightly differently. Instability could
  arise if objects are assigned to the wrong pool.
* Removed some unused memory pool types.

-- Tagged: CACHEBOY_0.PRE1

* Various code modules have been shuffled out of the main src/ directory
  and into library subdirectories as part of code housekeeping.

-- Imported Squid-2.HEAD.
