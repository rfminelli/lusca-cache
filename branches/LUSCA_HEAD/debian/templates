Template: lusca/fix_lines
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Upgrade squid.conf automatically?
 Incompatible settings have been found in the existing squid.conf file.
 .
 They will prevent Lusca/Squid from starting or working correctly.

 These settings can be corrected now. Please choose whether you want
 to apply the needed changes.

Template: lusca/fix_cachedir_perms
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Fix permissions of 'cache_dir'?
 The values for 'cache_effective_user' and/or 'cache_effective_group'
 in Lusca/Squid's configuration file are incompatible with the owner/group of the cache
 directories.
 . 
 Please choose whether this should be fixed automatically.
 .
 However, please note that if you specified a cache directory
 different from /var/spool/squid (such as /tmp), this could affect
 any other programs using that directory.
