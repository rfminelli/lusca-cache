* src/main.c has some assignments to iapp_ variables for copying bits of the
  config from Config. out to libiapp; these need to go away before the code
  is merged in.

* libiapp/comm.c has a #if NOTYET around the pconn uses tracking code.
  See if you can think of a way to migrate the pconn statistics stuff out
  into libiapp somehow and get the pconn cachemgr info page to just reference
  that.
